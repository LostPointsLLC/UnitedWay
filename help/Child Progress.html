				<p>The Child Progress Page is where you could view tasks that would, upon completion, help prepare your child for Kindergarten. Each of your children will have a set of tasks to be completed, divided up into four categories. As your child completes these tasks, his or her progress bar will fill up. Try having all of your children fill their progress bars completely!
