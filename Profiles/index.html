						<img id="news-feed-button" class="tablet-icon" src="Matt.png"/></a>
						<p>My name is Matthew Farrell and I am a recent graduate of the Parkland College Graphic Design Program. I have been a freelance designer since 2011 and recently acquired an entry level position at a local advertising and marketing agency. In my free time I enjoy skateboarding, painting, reading, and snowboarding in the winter. I served on the design team with everything from the logo creation to the user-interface design. I hope you enjoy the app and find it useful!</p>

						<h3>Ian Taylor</h3>

						<p>Hi! I'm Ian Taylor, junior at UIUC and majoring in Graphic Design! I've made a start up business with friends, freelance, and did design work for my old high school. Design is in everything all around us: a language, it is in everything from a street lamp to the device you are using right now, and to understand this language is a powerful ability. Fun fact: I practice Parkour, the art of movement navigating obstacles. This mindset and training helps my designing, namely solving problems (visual or special) efficiently.

							<h3>Yiyang Hu</h3>
							<p>I am Yiyang, a rising senior at the University of Illinois majoring in Industrial Engineering minoring in Computer Science. I have worked for Deloitte, State Farm and two start-ups before joining this team, and I love the tech industry as well as the people involved in it. Technology for me is about something that can enhance people's lives and make us more closely connected. <!--A fun fact about myself is that I am ambidextrous and I often enjoy taking notes with both hands.--></p>

							<h3>Pingxiao Ye</h3>
							<li><p>Hey I'm Pingxiao. I am currently a junior in Electrical Engineering minoring in Computer Science at the University of Illinois. An interesting fact about me is that I actually found out about it through Facebook by Henry. After joining the team, I worked primarily on this app's interface, and have enjoyed working with everyone on the team.</p></li>

							<h3>Eileen Waltz</h3>
							<p>My name is Eileen Walz. I'm a graduate student in the college of Library and Information Science with a Bachelors in Civil Engineering. My broad range of interests have led me to research the benefits of international service projects, create a community based internship program, teach a course on creative thinking, and develop information resources for the University of Illinois. I am constantly exploring new opportunities, new perspectives, and new environments. In the future I hope to nurture this same adventurous spirit in others.  </p>
