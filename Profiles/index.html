						<p>Hi! I'm Ian Taylor, junior at UIUC and majoring in Graphic Design! I've made a start up business with friends, freelance, and did design work for my old high school. Design is in everything all around us: a language, it is in everything from a street lamp to the device you are using right now, and to understand this language is a powerful ability. Fun fact: I practice Parkour, the art of movement navigating obstacles. This mindset and training helps my designing, namely solving problems (visual or special) efficiently.

							<h3>Jae Yun Song - Development</h3>
							<p>I am currently a senior in University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign majoring in computer science. I am interested in computer security related areas and looking forward to studying them in the future. One of the reason I got interested in computer security was that I was so paranoid about being hacked, whenever I put down my personal information into the computer. Constantly being afraid of getting my identity stolen, I have decided to study computer security in order to   
participate in creating a safer environment for computer users including myself.
