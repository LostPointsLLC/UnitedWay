<p> All parents/legal guardians of children who will be five years of age on or before September 1 are encouraged to register their children for kindergarten. </p>

<br>

<p> Early registration begins as early as March 1 for some schools. Check with your local school district for your kindergarten registration information. </p>

<br>

<p>In most cases, the parent/legal guardian will need to bring the following for kindergarten registration:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>Child’s official birth certificate (with raised seal)</li>
      <li>Child’s social security number</li>
      <li>Proof of residency (required for all registrations) – copy of signed mortgage, contract to build or lease agreement showing the owner/resident’s name and address or TWO of the following items:
         <ul>
            <li>Utility bills which have the name and address of the resident</li>
            <li>Valid driver’s license</li>
            <li>Voter registration card</li>
            <li>State medical card</li>
            <li>Notarized affidavit of residency from the parent or person with whom the child is residing, affirming that the child eats and sleeps at the residence</li>
         </ul>

   </ul> 

<br>

<p> All students entering kindergarten must provide documentation of a current
physical examination and immunizations PRIOR to starting school, AND proof of a dental exam. You do not need proof of a physical or dental exam to register your child.</p>

<br>

<p>It is recommended that you make your child’s appointments for kindergarten physical and dental exam by April or even earlier! Students who do not have physical and dental exams by the first day of school may not be allowed to attend school.</p>
