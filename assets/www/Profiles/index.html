						<p>My name is Matthew Farrell and I am a recent graduate of the Parkland College Graphic Design Program. I have been a freelance designer since 2011 and recently acquired an entry level position at a local advertising and marketing agency. In my free time I enjoy skateboarding, painting, reading, and snowboarding in the winter. I served on the design team with everything from the logo creation to the user-interface design. I hope you enjoy the app and find it useful!</p>

						<p>Hi! I'm Ian Taylor, junior at UIUC and majoring in Graphic Design! I've made a start up business with friends, freelance, and did design work for my old high school. Design is in everything all around us: a language, it is in everything from a street lamp to the device you are using right now, and to understand this language is a powerful ability. Fun fact: I practice Parkour, the art of movement navigating obstacles. This mindset and training helps my designing, namely solving problems (visual or special) efficiently.

							<p>Greetings and salutations, all! My name is Justin and I am a graphic design student at Parkland College. I have been studying there for about 4 years, working at my own pace. This project with the United Way Pre-K app is the first large scale project I have been a part of. On this project, I helped to design the user interface as well as some of the advertising design. Past projects include t-shirts for plays I have been involved with and graphic design work for some local Indie Film projects. In fact, I actually have my own IMDB page because I was named Art Director for the short film called <i>The Window Into Time</i>.

							<p>I'm Paul, and I'm both fascinated and a bit afraid of how fast technology is changing today, in front of my own eyes! I hope I get to see the day when I'll be able to create an artificial intelligence that will code for me (effectively outsourcing myself...). For this project, I was mainly involved with database management, as well as optimizing the app. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

							<h3>Jae Yun Song</h3>

							<p>I am currently a senior in University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign majoring in computer science. I am interested in computer security related areas and looking forward to studying them in the future. One of the reason I got interested in computer security was that I was so paranoid about being hacked, whenever I put down my personal information into the computer. Constantly being afraid of getting my identity stolen, I have decided to study computer security in order to   
participate in creating a safer environment for computer users including myself.

							<p>Hello! My name is Vaidehi Sishtla. I'm a senior in Computer Science at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I was born in India but I grew up in Bloomington, IL. The funny thing about my college career is that even though I came as a Freshmen with no knowledge in programming, I will be leaving with respect for the field and experience. For this project, I was on the frontend and the backend. This project was a lot of fun and I gained a lot of experience in coding as well as management! A fun fact about me is that as a kid, I always wanted to be famous so something people do not know about me is that I was in a South Indian advertisement!</p>
